# Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declaration: Trends and Patterns

## Problem Statement:
Disasters in the United States — ranging from hurricanes and floods to wildfires and pandemics — trigger federal declarations that activate critical assistance programs. While FEMA provides extensive data on these declarations, the raw dataset is complex and difficult to interpret without specialized tools.
This project addresses the challenge by transforming FEMA’s Disaster Declarations dataset into interactive dashboards that:

- Summarize disaster activity across years, states, and incident types.

- Reveal temporal trends, durations, and seasonal patterns of disasters.

- Map geographic distribution and highlight repeatedly affected areas.

- Track activation of Individual Assistance (IA), Individual and Household Programs (IH), and Public Assistance (PA).

- Compare disaster types to assess severity and recurrence.

- Provide historical insights and predictive signals to support planning and resource allocation.
